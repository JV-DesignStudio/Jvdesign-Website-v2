The file `downloads/colouring-book.pdf` is intended to be a PDF document. Since I cannot generate the actual PDF content here, you will need to create the PDF file separately using a PDF creation tool or software. 

Once you have created the PDF of the colouring book, you can save it as `colouring-book.pdf` in the `downloads` directory of your project. 

If you need help with creating the PDF or any specific content for it, please let me know!
